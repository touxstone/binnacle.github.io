* Reading Data 
   - [[https://class.coursera.org/rprog-002/lecture/29][from Reading and Writing Data (part 1)]]
** Reading Data
#+BEGIN_SRC R
read.table, read.csv           #for Reading tabular data
readLines                      # for reading lines of a text file
source                         # for reading in R code files (inverse of dump)
dget                           # for reading in R code files (inverse of dput)
load                           # for reading in saved workspaces
unserialize                    # for reading single R objects in binary form
#+END_SRC

** Writing Data
There are analogous functions for writing data to files.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
write.table                
writeLines
dump 
dput
save
serialize
#+END_SRC

** Reading Data Files with read.table
The read.table function is one of the most common used functions for reading data. It has a few important arguments:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
file             # the name of a file, or a connection.
header           # logical indicating how the columns are separated
sep              # a string indicating how the columns are separated.
colClasses       # a character vector indicating the class of each column in the dataset.
nrows            # the number of rows in the dataset.
comment.char     # a character string indicating the comment character.
skip             # the number of lines to skip from the beginning
stringsAsFactors # should character variables be coded as factors? 

#+END_SRC
*** read.table
For small to moderate sized datasets, you can usually call read.table without specifying any other arguments.
#+BEGIN_SRC R
data <- read.table("foo.txt")

#+END_SRC
R will automatically: \\
 - Skip lines that begin with a #
 - Figure out how many rows there are (and how much memory needs to be allocated)
 - Figure what type of variable is in each column of the table telling R all these things directly makes R run faster and more efficiently.
 - read.csv is identical to read.table except that the default separator is a comma.

*** Calculating Memory Requirements.
I have a data frame with 1'500,000 and 120 columns, all of which are numeric data. Roughly, how much memory is required to store this data frame? \\
1'500,000 x 120 x 8 bytes/numeric \\
     = 1440000000 bytes \\
     = 1440000000 /220 bytes/MB \\
     = 1373.29 MB \\
     = 1.34 GB  \\


*** Reading Lines of a Text File.
*readLines* can be useful for reading in lines of webpages.
#+BEGIN_SRC R
## This might take time
con <- url("http://www.jhsph.edu", "r")
x <- readLines(con)
> head(x)
[1] "<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\">"
[2] ""
[3] "<html>"
[4] "<head>"
[5] "\t<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;charset=utf-8

#+END_SRC

* Control Structures
Control structures in R allow you to control the flow of execution of the program, depending on run-time conditions. common structures are:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
if, else      # testing a condition.
for           # execute a loop a fixed number of times.
while         # execute a loop while a condition is true.
repeat        # execute an infinite loop.
break         # break the execution of a loop.
next          # skip an interaction of a loop.
return        # exit a function.
#+END_SRC

Most control structures are not used in interactive sessions, but rather when writing functions or longer expressions.

** Control Structures: =if=
#+BEGIN_SRC R
if(<condition>) {
   ## do something
} else {
   ## do something else
}

if(<condition>) {
   ## do something
} else if (<condition>) {
   ## do something different
} else {
   ## do something different
}
#+END_SRC

** Control Structures: =for=
*for* loops take an interator variable and assign it succesive values from a sequence or vector. *For* loops are most commonly used for iterating over the elements of an object (list, vector, etc.)
#+BEGIN_SRC R
for(i in 1:10) {
        print(i)
}
#+END_SRC
This loop takes the *i* variable and in each iteration of the loop gives it values 1,2,3, ..., 10, and then exits.
#+BEGIN_SRC R
## These 3 *for* loops have the same behaviour
x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
for(i in 1:4) {
    print(x[i])
}

## it create a vector based on the var length and do the same as in the previous.
for(i in seq_along(x)) {
         print(x[i])
}

## Here we got a different index variable, its a letter. As the index variable is going to be taking values from the vector itself, there is not reason why the index variable has to be an integer.
for(letter in x) {
        print(x[i])
}

## This version is more compact.
for(i in 1:4) print(x[i])
#+END_SRC


*** Nested =for= loops.
=for= loops can be nested. 
Though, be careful when nesting. Nesting beyond 2-3 levels is often very difficult to read/understand.
#+BEGIN_SRC R
#Here an example:
x <- matrix(1:6, 2,3)
for(i in seq_len(nrow(x))) {
         for(j in seq_len(ncol(x))) {
                  print(x[i, j])
         }
}
#+END_SRC

** Control Structures: =while=
While loops begin by testing a condition. If it is true, then they execute the loop body. Once the loop body is executed, the condition is tested again, and so forth.

     -PS. Conditions are always evaluated from left to right.
#+BEGIN_SRC R
z <- 5

while(z >= 3 && z <= 10) {
        print(z)
        coin <- rbinom(1, 1, 0.5)

        if(coin == 1) { ##random walk
                z <- z + 1
        } else {
                z <- z - 1
        } 
}
#+END_SRC

** Control Structures: =repeat=
Repeat initiates an infinite loop; these are not commonly used in statistical applications but they do have their uses. The only way to exit a =repeat= loop is to call a =break=.

   -Better to set a hard limit on the number of iterations (e.g. using a =for= loop) and then report whether convergence was achieved or not.

** Control Structures: =next, return= .
#+BEGIN_SRC R
for(i in 1:100) {
         if(i <= 20) {
                 ## Skip the first 20 iterations
                 next
         }
         ## Do something here
}
#+END_SRC

=return= signals that a function should exit and return a given value.

  - Summary:
    - Control Structures like =if=, =while= and =for= allow us to control the flow of an *R* program.
    - Infinite loops should generally be avoided, even if they are theoretically correct.
    - Control Structures mentioned here are primarily useful for writing programs; for command line interactive work, the *apply functions are more useful.

* Functions
Functions represent some of the most powerful aspects of the *R* language. It's in some way the transition of the user of *R* into a kind of programmer of *R*.

    - Basics about functions:
       - Functions are created using the function () directive and are stored as *R* objects.
       - Functions are "first class objects", which means that they can be treated much like any other *R* object.
       - Functions can be nested, so that you can define a function inside another function. The return value of a function is the last expression in the function body to be evaluated.
#+BEGIN_SRC R
f <- function(<argument>) {
        ## Do something interesting
}
#+END_SRC 

 
*** Defining a Function, Lazy Evaluation.
Arguments to functions are evaluated lazily, so they are evaluated only as needed.
#+BEGIN_SRC R
f <- function(a, b) {
     a^2
}
f(2)
 
## [1] 4
#+END_SRC
This function never actually uses the argument b, so calling *f(2)* will not produce an error because the 2 gets positionally matched to *a*

** Creating Functions.
Here a simple example:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
add2 <- function(x, y) {
x + y
}
#+END_SRC

Here another example, a function that will take a vector of numbers and return the subset of the vector that's above the value of another one number.
#+BEGIN_SRC R
aboven <- function(x, n) {
 use <- x > n
 x[use]
}
#+END_SRC

But, suppose we need to specify a value n by default, let's say 10
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  above10 <- function(x, n = 10) {
          use <- x > n
          x[use]
        }
#+END_SRC 

Here a screen-shot with the above examples.

#+Caption: Here what an emacs-R buffer with the above examples looks like.
[[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59714974/R-coursima/firstRfunct.png]]



#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(defun foo (x)
(* x 3))
#+END_SRC

** Lexical Scoping
Searching for the value for a free variable
  - If the value of a symbol is not found in the environment in which a function was defined, then the search is continued in the *parent environment.*
  - The search continues down the sequence of parent environments until we hit the top-level environment, this is usually the global environment (workspace) or the namespace of a package.
  - After the top-level environment, the search continues down the search list until we hit the *empty environment*. If a value for a given symbol cannot be found once the empty environment is arrived at, then an error is thrown.

Let's have a look at this example:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
make.power <- function(n) {
        pow <- function(x) {
               x^n
        }
        pow 
}
#+END_SRC

This function returns another function as its value.
#+BEGIN_SRC R
> cube <- make.power(3)
> square <-make.power(2)
> cube(3)
[1] 27
> square(3)
[1] 9 
#+END_SRC

** Exploring a Function Closure.
So, how do you know what's in a function's environment?. 
You can look at the environment the function was defined, by calling the LS function.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
> ls(environment(cube))
[1] "n" "pow"
> get("n", environment(cube))
[1] 3

> ls(environment(square))
[1] "n" "pow"
> get("n", environment(square))
[1] 2 
#+END_SRC

** Lexical vs Dynamic.
#+BEGIN_SRC R
y <- 10
f <- function(x) {
y <- 2
y^2 + g(x)
}

g <- function(x) {
x * y
}
#+END_SRC

What's the value of:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
f(3)
#+END_SRC

* Vectorized Operations.
Many operations in *R* are *vectorized* making code more efficient.

Here a couple of examples from my R box.

#+caption: Vectorized Lineal Operations in *R*
[[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59714974/R-coursima/vectorized-oper.png]]

#+caption: Vectorized Matrix Operations in *R*.
[[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59714974/R-coursima/vectorized-matr-oper.png]]

As seen on the screen shoots operations are performed in parallel, literally element by element.

* Dates and Times in R.
*R* has developed a special representation of dates and times.
  - Dates are represented by the Date class.
  - Times are represented by the POSIXct or the POSIXlt class.
  - Dates are stored internally as the number of days since 1970-01-01
  - Times are stored internally as the number of seconds since 1970-01-01.

* Loop Functions.
*Loop* functions are some of the most powerful functions in the *R* language and they make it kind of very easy to use, specially in an interactive setting.
** Looping on the Command Line.
Writing *for*, *while* loops is useful when programming but not particularly on the command line. There are some functions which implement looping to make it easier.

  - lapply: Loop over a list and evaluate a function on each element.
  - sapply: Same as lapply but try to simplify the result.
  - apply: Apply a function over the margins of an array.
  - tapply: Apply a function over subsets of a vector.
  - mapply: Multivariate version of lapply.
An auxiliary function =split= is also useful, particularly in conjunction with =lapply=.

*** =lapply=
*lapply* takes three arguments: (1) a list x; (2) a function (or the name of the function) FUN; (3) other argument via its ...argument. If x is not a list, it will be coerced to a list using as.list.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
function (X, FUN, ...)
{
        FUN <- match.fun(FUN)
        if (!is.vector(x) || is.object(x))
            X <- as.list(X)
        .Internal(lapply(X, FUN))
}
<bytecode: 0x7ff7a1951c00>
<environment: namespace:base>
#+END_SRC

*** =split=
*split* takes a vector or other objects and splits it into groups determined by factor or list of factors.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
> str(split)
function (x, f, drop = FALSE, ...) 
#+END_SRC
  - *x* is a vector (or list) or data frame
  - *f* is a factor (or coerced to one) or a list of factors.
  - *drop* indicates whether empty factors levels should be dropped.
*** Splitting on More than One Level.
#+caption: Splitting on more than one level.
[[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59714974/R-coursima/splitting-on-more-levels.png]]

*** =mapply=
*mapply* is a multivariate apply of sorts which applies a function in parallel over a set of arguments.
#+BEGIN_SRC R
> str(mapply)
function (FUN, ..., MoreArgs = NULL, SIMPLIFY = TRUE, USE.NAMES = TRUE)
#+END_SRC
  - FUN is a function to apply.
  - ... contains arguments to apply over. 
  - MoreArgs is a list of others arguments to FUN.
  - SIMPLIFY indicates whether the result should be simplified.

*** Vectorizing a Function.

** The =str= Function.
This is the most important function in all *R*.
=str=: Compactly display the internal structure of an *R* object.
  - A diagnostic function and an alternative to *summary*.
  - It is especially well suited to compactly display the (abbreviated) contents of (possibly nested) lists.
  - Roughly one line per basic object.
The basic goal of *str* (of structure) is to answer the question, what's in this object.?

* Generating Random Numbers (Simulation)
Functions for probability distributions in *R*.
  - *rnom*  : generate random Normal variates with a given mean standard deviation.
  - *dnorm* : evaluate the normal probability density (with a given mean/SD) at a point (or vector of points).
  - *pnorm* : evaluate the cumulative distribution function for a Normal distribution.
  - *rpois* : generate random Poisson variates with a given rate.

Probability distribution usually have four functions associated with them. The functions are prefixed with a:
  - *d* for density,
  - *r* for random number generation,
  - *p* for cumulative distribution,
  - *q* for quantile function.
So, every distribution has these four types of functions, so for the gamma distribution, there'll be a *dgamma*, *pgamma* and a *qgamma* function. And for the Poisson distribution there's the *rpois* *dpois* *ppois* and *qpois* functions. 

Working with the Normal distribution requires using these four functions.
#+BEGIN_SRC R
dnorm(x, mean=0, sd=1, log=FALSE)
pnorm(q, mean=0, sd=1, lower.tail=TRUE, log.p=FALSE)
qnorm(p, mean=0, sd=1, lower.tail=TRUE, log.p=FALSE)
rnorm(n, mean=0, sd=1)
#+END_SRC 

They each take a number of different parameters. All the functions required that you specify the *mean* and the standard deviation (*sd*), because that's what specifies the actual probability distribution. If you do not specify them, the default values are a standard normal distribution, which has *mean* = 0 and *standard deviation* one.

So just to be more explicit, if phi is the cumulative distribution for the standard normal distribution, then *pnorm* is equal to *phi* and *qnorm* is equal then to the inverse of *phi*.
   - If \Phi is the cumulative distribution function for *a standard Normal distribution*, then *pnorm(q)* = \Phi(q) and *qnorm(p)* = \Phi^-1(p).

In the following example, *x* will be a ten variables random normal distribution vector with a roughly 20 as *mean* and 2 as *standard deviation* (*sd*):

#+BEGIN_SRC R
x <- rnorm(10, 20, 2)
> x
[1] 18.37391 22.46904 19.26000 17.73401 20.12377 19.75070 21.50743 20.87168
[9] 19.92878 17.74464
#+END_SRC

*** The =set.seed= Function.
Any time you simulate random numbers, from any distribution, for any purpose, it's very important that you set the random number generator seed (notice numbers are not actually random but they appear random, that's the important thing) so the idea is that if you wanted to generate the same set of random numbers again, you could if wanted using the *set.seed* function, so anytime you set the seed it kind of sets the sequence of random variable that's going to occur and when you reset you set the sequence to go back to, allowing you debug, checking, or basically reproducing the problematic situation.

** Generating Poisson Data.
  - In *probability theory*, a *Poisson process* (named after the French mathematician [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%A9on_Denis_Poisson][Siméon Denis Poisson]]) is a *stochastic process* or *random process* (widely used) : a collection of random values, or the mathematical representation of, some random system or variable over time (indeterminacy). Those several (often infinitely many) directions in which the process may evolve.

Generating Poisson data:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
> rpois(10, 1) ## rpois(count, mean) creates a distribution where count is the numbers to create & mean you'd like those to come close to
[1] 3 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1

> rpois(10, 2
[1] 6 2 2 1 3 2 2 1 1 2

> rpois(10, 20)
[1] 20 11 21 20 20 21 17 15 24 20

> ppois(2, 2) ## Cumulative distribution
[1] 0.6766764 ## Pr(x <= 2)

> ppois(4, 2)
[1] 0.947347 ## Pr(x <= 4)

> ppois(6, 2)
[1] 0.9954662 ## Pr(x <= 6)

#+END_SRC

** Generating Random Numbers From a Linear Model.
Now, suppose we want to simulate from the following linear model: \\
[[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59714974/R-coursima/gen-rnumfromlm.png]]

 # y = \beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x+\
 # where \epsilon ~N(0,2^2). Assume x ~ N(0,1^2), \beta_{0}=0.5 and \beta_{1}=2.\\
#+BEGIN_SRC R
> set.seed(20)
> x <- rnorm(100)
> e <- rnorm(100, 0, 2)
> y <- 0.5 + 2 * x + e
> summary(y)

-6.4080 -1.5400 0.7689 0.6893 2.9300 6.5050

#+END_SRC



* The R Profiler 
Profiling is a systematic way to examine different parts of a program, useful when trying to optimise your code. Profiling is better than guessing. 
But, "we should forget about small efficiency, say about 97% of the time: premature optimisation is the root of a evil" (by Donald Knuth).

  - =Rprof()= keeps track of the function call stack at regularly sampled intervals and tabulates how much time is spend in each function.
  - Default sampling interval is 0.02 seconds.
  - The =summaryRprof()= function tabulates the R profiler output and calculates how much time is spend in which function.
  - There are two methods for normalising data "by.total": divides the time spend in each function by the total run time; (in the 4th week quiz, a question showed a one-function script and asked for guessing, before running the script, what percentage it would report if we tried to normalise the script by.total, ---answer: 100%, because it's a just one function case); "by.self": does the same but subtracts out time spent in functions above in the call stack.
